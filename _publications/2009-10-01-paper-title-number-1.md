excerpt: "This paper presents novel optimality criteria for subgroup splitting (named WHOMP) in comparative experiments, such as clinical trials, social experiments, and A/B tests. Furthermore, we provide efficient algorithms to estimate the WHOMP optimal solutions. Finally, the paper offers comprehensive analytical comparisons and numerical experiments to demonstrate the significant advantages of WHOMP over traditional methods, including random partitioning, covariate-adaptive randomization, rerandomization, and anti-clustering."
